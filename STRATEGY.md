Strategic Phase 1: Establishing a Closed-Loop Production Cycle in Ukraine

To all stakeholders interested in the project, we present the roadmap for Phase One:

1. Resource Sovereignty & Extraction Rights Securing shared or exclusive access to critical rare-earth and mineral deposits within Ukraine’s "Ukrainian Shield." This provides the raw material foundation for our entire technological ecosystem:

2. Neodymium (Nd): Subbotse-Shcherbakivska zone (Kirovohrad region) — Vital for high-frequency generators.

3. Lithium (Li): Polokhivske deposit & "Dobra" site (Kirovohrad region) — Largest European reserves of high-purity spodumene for energy storage.

4. Silicon (Si): Ovruch, Tolkachiv, and Banych deposits (Zhytomyr/Sumy regions) — High-grade quartzite ($SiO_2$ > 99%) for the solar industry.

5. Sodium (Na): Izmail (Odesa) and Tereblyanske (Zakarpattia) deposits — Strategic reserves for next-gen battery technologies.

6. 2. Industrial Infrastructure Upgrade Executing the procurement and installation of missing components for processing plants within the existing industrial cluster in the Kirovohrad region. This will enable on-site refinement of raw ore into industrial-grade materials.
  
   3. 3. Strategic Metal Procurement Facilitating bulk acquisition of Copper (Cu) and Silver (Ag) to ensure high-conductivity components for solar cells and neodymium modulators.
     
      4. 4. Advanced Manufacturing Integration Implementation of turnkey technologies to transform refined raw materials into structured end-products (photovoltaic cells and energy units).
        
         5. 5. Implementation of the First Closed-Loop Cycle Execution of the full production cycle — from extraction to the assembly of finished solar panels — entirely within Ukraine.
           
            6. Execution Readiness: All listed actions possess a realistic timeframe and depend solely on the synchronized deployment of financial instruments into the respective industrial clusters.
